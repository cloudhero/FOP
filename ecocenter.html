<p>Located amid a serene botanical setting, the EcoCenter will serve as an international training facility, ecological support tool and recruiting vehicle as well as an environmental education platform. It will be a place where world renown scientists conduct research and demonstrate their findings, where schoolchildren learn about conservation and restoration, and where visitors can experience ground breaking environmental processes first-hand.</p>

<p>The EcoCenter will be a place where our precious natural resources are preserved for the next generation, a society dedicated to conservation, recycling, and using alternative energy sources is developed â€“ creating a sustainable future. All ages will be able to come together to learn about ecological stewardship.</p><br>

According to the world tourism Association, ecotourism is one of the fastest growing travel trends and is estimated to be a $77 billion market.
              
              <p>The nonprofit (501 c 3) eco-center will be a unique ecotourists destination; drawing people from across the world that are concerned with ecological stewardship. More than 30 acres of tentacle gardens and green space along with natural and constructed wetlands, provide a parklike setting and encourage self guided horticulture and bird watching tours.</p>
              <p>Visitors can explore a working greenhouse and outdoor nurseries as well as observe firsthand the centers eco-village. Developers, community leaders, citizens and students can witness the benefits of capturing treated wastewater and storm water and using it as an asset rather than liability. Scientific exploration trips to the bayou and local marine sanctuaries will introduce the world to the natural habitat and unique ecology.</p>

From initial construction jobs to more than 200 full-time permanent staff positions, the center will provide long-term skills rears for the local community.
              
              <p>The economic impact of the eco-center will be remarkable. Not only will the leaders drawn to the state because of eco-center, but they will, as well as local citizens, will also spend millions and local businesses, restaurants, hotels and area attractions.</p>
              <p>Early projections indicate the eco-center could generate billions in annual revenue for the region. People from various companies and agencies, such as FEMA, World Bank, Asian development Bank and other global relief groups can also visit the center for training and education.</p>

  <div class="AccordionPanelContent"><strong>Decentralized Wastewater Recycling</strong><br>
        
        Demonstrating production of odorless, colorless, sterilized and fully treated wastewater at any location, and on any scale. The simple process takes up little space, is extremely energy efficient, and is cost effective to install. A fully automated, low oh and M facility can tap into as many sewer and produce boutique water tailored for when restricted reuse, environmental restoration, groundwater recharge, or process water that serves as a resource for other commercial uses, such as production of biofuels.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Eco-village</strong><br>
        Richly developed as an answer to the devastation from the Indonesian tsunami, and later updated to meet the needs of FEMA, eco-village will demonstrate well don't and comfortable housing that can be set up in a response centers to house its place people and responders. The components based on repealing toward factors in common materials can be containerized and set up in a very short time. Water, wastewater, medications, and electrical are all ready to connect to village scale modular infrastructure, and solar energy systems are included. Hurricane or flood survivability are strong design features. Other building systems for large facility buildings will use proven low-cost and rapidly built building systems with the same sustainability and survivability qualities.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Water Supply</strong><br>
       Capable of accepting water from any source during a disaster, the water filtration and purification plant will demonstrate water production using a simple modular process and components that can be assembled in short notice. The system is energy-efficient, and also includes proprietary equipment for softening, improving irrigation efficiency, cooling system performance, and crop yields.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Aquaponics</strong><br>
       Aquaponics refers to the combined production flora and fauna in a macrocosm that recirculate the water used to raise fish, crawfish, and shrimp to aquatic farming production stages that produce crops, such as lettuce and basil.  The nutrient waste from the aquaculture seafood serves as fertilizer for the plant production, which in turn cleans and circulates the water.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Algae Biofuel Production</strong><br>
        Recent work has demonstrated high production rates for specific varieties of LG that produce oils. These oils are readily converted to liquid fuels, colluding bio diesel. FO P has extensive experience and I intensely LG production facility design. Other applications involve production of specific LG derived high-value pharmaceutical compounds.</p>
        
        
        
        <p><strong>Biomass Conversion</strong><br>
        Prolific invasive water plants such as water higher niece and Till can choke waterways, but they also remove substances that contribute to pollution and you troll location, and have high growth in primary production rates. These nuance weeds can be crushed and their juices used as a feedstock for biofuel production. Remaining fibrous cereal will serve as a feedstock for other energy and fuel production technologies.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Liquid Fuel Production</strong><br>
        With the development of cellulosic conversion processes and advanced catalysts, a wide variety of nonfood crops and biomass can be converted to liquid fuels, including ethanol. The EcoCenter will demonstrate a range of hybrid renewable electric, hydrogen, and non-petroleum derived liquid fueled vehicles, generators, and pumps.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Waiste-to-Energy</strong><br>
        Anoxic gasification is a scalable process that heats and vaporizes a wide range of wastes to produce a syngas that can then be used to directly produce electricity, or converted to liquid fuels, including bio diesel, ethanol, methanol.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Desalination</strong><br>
        The EcoCenter will demonstrate state-of-the-art desalination approaches that address the two main factors that inhibit wider deployment of membrane technology: energy costs, and membrane life. The technology includes proprietary devices in unique combinations of readily available equipment.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Low Impact Development</strong><br>
        In an area so dramatically affected by flooding, The EcoCenter will employ all of the tools of LID to demonstrate watershed restoration, even in an urbanized setting. This shall include stream drainage restoration, wetlands and buffer restoration, groundwater and base flow recharge, previous paving systems, runoff capture and reuse, environmental restoration using recycled water, and an overall balancing of previous and impervious areas across the project site.</p></div>
